# Vue Documentation

Vue Documentation is a tool designed for creating technical documentation, focusing on advanced JavaScript.

This is my second project in Vue.js that I coded under the guidance of an experienced programmer. We communicated using JIRA, where he assigned tasks to me. Additionally, we had weekly meetings to discuss possible improvements.

## Project Overview

The Vue Documentation project is dedicated to providing comprehensive technical documentation for advanced JavaScript concepts. The tool incorporates various technologies to enhance the documentation creation process, making it accessible and informative.

## Technologies

- **HTML:** Structure for documentation pages.
- **SCSS:** Styling to enhance the visual appeal of the documentation.
- **JavaScript:** Enhances interactivity and functionality.
- **Vue.js:** Progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
